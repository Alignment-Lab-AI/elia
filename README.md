A quick experiment using Textual to demonstrate how you might build a ChatGPT client in the terminal.

This is just a small demo app. I hope it inspires someone or provides a foundation for a more powerful ChatGPT TUI.

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running it if you want to give it a go.
